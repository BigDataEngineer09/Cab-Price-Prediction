# Cab-Price-Prediction

**Objective:**
The objective of this implementation is to create a Flask web application for predicting taxi fare prices based on input parameters such as city, cab company, gender, and distance traveled. The application allows users to select these parameters using dropdown menus and input fields. Upon submission, the application predicts the fare price using a trained Random Forest Regressor model.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Develop a user-friendly web interface where users can input parameters for predicting taxi fare prices.
2. Utilize client-side validation to ensure that users provide all required input parameters.
3. Implement server-side validation to handle edge cases, such as missing input or incorrect data types.
4. Train a Random Forest Regressor model using  taxi fare data to predict fare prices accurately.
5. Display the predicted fare price to the user on the same page, along with the input parameters.
6. Deploy the Flask application locally for testing and further development.
